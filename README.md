ðŸŽ¹ Virtual Piano Autoplayer

The Virtual Piano Autoplayer is a handy Python-based desktop application designed to automate piano note playback on virtual instruments, perfect for practicing, learning, or simply enjoying automated musical sequences. It allows you to input single notes (e.g., a), chords ([abc]), and pauses (|) using a simple text format. You can choose between manual playback, stepping through notes with a key press (-), or engaging autoplay (=) for continuous performance. The application offers real-time control over playback speed via BPM (Beats Per Minute), adjustable with a slider or instant hotkeys ([ for slower, ] for faster). Your unique note sequences are intelligently saved and can be loaded later, and you can even loop manual playback for repetitive practice. With customizable themes and global hotkey support, this autoplayer provides a seamless and personalized experience for bringing your piano notes to life.
